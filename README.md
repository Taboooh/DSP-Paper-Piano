# DSP-Paper-Piano
The focus of this project is to convert visual input into visual and audio output. This is done by taking in video from a webcam, and outputting piano note audio signals and displaying keys being pressed on a digital representation of a keyboard. This is achieved in python through the use of the openCV and Pygame libraries.
